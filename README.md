# Svelte Routify Typescript Template

Svelte template with various useful features:

- Typescript and SASS/SCSS integration via [svelte-preprocess](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte-preprocess)

- Babel support (compatible with IE11)

- File based routing using [Routify](https://routify.dev/)

- Hot module reloading

- PWA support, with autogenerated pre-caching

- Quality-of-life Rollup plugins (del, copy, replace)

- 2 bundle outputs for modern and legacy browsers following the [module/nomodule pattern](https://philipwalton.com/articles/deploying-es2015-code-in-production-today/)

## Prerequisites

- npm

- node.js

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repo

2. Install npm dependencies

    ```bash
    npm i
    ```

3. Start the server in development mode. Server listens on localhost:5000. Changes to source files should be reflected on the webpages

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

4. Build for production when ready

    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

5. Serve static bundle

    ```bash
    npm run start
    ```

## Details

### Syntax Highlighting

VS Code can offer properly syntax highlighting for Svelte files using the [Svelte plugin](https://github.com/sveltejs/language-tools/tree/master/packages/svelte-vscode). A `svelte.config.js` file must be exposed in the root directory of your project.

The Svelte plugin can also offer proper syntax highlighting for Typescript code in `<script>` tags and SASS/SCSS in `<style>` tags. Just remember to include `<script lang="typescript" or lang"ts">` for Typescript and `<style lang="sass" or lang="scss">` for SASS/SCSS.

### PWA

Boilerplate code is autogenerated by integrating [Workbox Build](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/modules/workbox-build) with a Rollup plugin. Currently, template uses `generateSW` to generate the service-worker files, with precaching configured to cache all files in the generated bundle and static assets. Runtime caching can be added by adding the appropriate options into the `workboxGenerateSW` plugin in `rollup.config.json`.

The installation prompt for installing the application to the home screen is not set up by default, but can easily be configured by importing `deferredPrompt` from `src/register-sw.js`.

## In-progress

Here are some features that are currently being worked on:

- PostCSS integration

- Custom type declaration for certain modules to resolve error messages during build stage
